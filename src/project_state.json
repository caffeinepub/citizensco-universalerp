  "summary": "CitizensCo UniversalERP is a React (Vite) SPA backed by an ICP Motoko canister with Internet Identity auth, server-enforced RBAC, Stripe checkout via IC HTTP outcalls, and in-browser wallet connectors (Oisy default, Plug supported). The project has begun true multi-organization support (organizations + org-scoped memberships/roles) and is actively working through an incremental rollout to make wallets/transactions organization-scoped with safe, stepwise migration/compatibility changes. Most ERP modules beyond auth/profile/orgs/Stripe/wallet-connector scaffolding remain largely UI shells pending backend CRUD implementations and full tenant isolation across all domains.",
