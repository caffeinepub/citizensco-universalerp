The project has progressed into multi-tenant work: Phase 1 multi-organization (org entity + memberships) has been initiated/iterated, and ongoing work is focused on making wallets/transactions organization-scoped (org isolation) via incremental backend changes (Activities/Micro-steps) to avoid execution-limit issues. Wallet connector support now includes both Oisy and Plug, with Oisy set as the default.",
