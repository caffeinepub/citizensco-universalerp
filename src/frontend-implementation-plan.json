Keep existing readiness CTAs (e.g., \"Go to Admin Dashboard\" when Stripe is not configured) intact by rendering both actions together in a responsive layout (e.g., wrap/stack on small screens). Ensure the CTA remains admin-only by relying on the existing admin gating (useIsCallerAdmin from the authorization-based access control). Use existing shadcn/ui Button composition (do not edit files under frontend/src/components/ui). Verify the component's usage instructions before implementing."
