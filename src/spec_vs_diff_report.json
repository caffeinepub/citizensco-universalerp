The diff shows admin-only gating in DeploymentReadinessBanner, but the provided truncation does not include any visible CTA/link to \"/activity-3\", so the core navigation/button requirement cannot be verified from the evidence. Additionally, an unrelated set of features is described/added in frontend-file-summaries.txt (e.g., /wallets route, cart, storefront, HRMS/CRM hooks), which were not requested.",
