  "summary": "The diff adds UI and client-side logic to display an admin-only deployment readiness banner/section (checking access control initialization and Stripe configuration, with recommendations including CAFFEINE_ADMIN_TOKEN and navigation to Admin Dashboard). However, the BuildRequest’s core Step 6 requirements about actually deploying the post-migration build to the network and confirming deployment/URL/runtime readiness are not implemented in code changes (and cannot be verified from the diff). The diff also includes multiple unrelated product features (HRMS employee management, wallets route, ecommerce/cart/checkout changes, Stripe setup modal, etc.) that go beyond deployment readiness verification.",
