  "summary": "Frontend Wallet Overview page was added and routing/navigation to it was wired via TanStack Router and the Header. Backend changes are present in backend/main.mo, but the diff excerpt does not show any wallet read API implementations or authorization logic required by REQ-1.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Implement backend wallet read APIs (listWallets scoped to organization, getWallet by walletId with org authorization, getWalletOverviewResponse with per-wallet overview metrics) with authorization enforcement (org members limited to their org; global admins can access any org) and deterministic org-scoped results.",
      "reason": "backend/main.mo diff content is truncated and does not show any new public canister methods for listWallets/getWallet/getWalletOverviewResponse or any org-scoped authorization checks; therefore implementation cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
