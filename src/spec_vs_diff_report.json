  "summary": "REQ-1 cannot be verified from the provided diff excerpt because the `backend/main.mo` content is truncated and the visible portion does not show any wallet/transaction/event type definitions. Additionally, `project_state.json` was modified even though the BuildRequest explicitly constrained this step to be “types only” in `backend/main.mo`.",

      "reason": "The visible portion of the truncated `backend/main.mo` diff shows organization/product/CRM/HRMS types but does not show any wallet-related types (wallet/transaction/event), so implementation cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",
